## Professional Profile
Backend and systems-focused engineer with a strong inclination toward  
**infrastructure-aware backend design**, **network-centric system behavior**,  
and **Linux-based service reliability**.

Experienced in working close to the system layer, where connection stability,  
resource efficiency, and predictable behavior under continuous load  
are more critical than surface-level features.

Comfortable operating independently, exploring problems from first principles,  
and building solutions that are meant to **run long, stay stable, and fail gracefully**.

Currently **open to work** for backend, infrastructure, systems, or reliability-focused roles.

## Core Strengths

**Backend Engineering**
- Backend service development with awareness of system and network constraints
- RESTful API implementation and backend service orchestration
- Emphasis on correctness, maintainability, and long-term stability

**Systems & Infrastructure**
- Linux-based service design, process supervision, and automation
- Hands-on experience managing long-running services
- Resource control, optimization, and operational reliability

**Network & Connectivity**
- Practical understanding of data transport and protocol behavior
- Designing systems that maintain stable connectivity under variable conditions
- Experience with connection persistence and low-level traffic handling concepts

**Reliability & Security Mindset**
- Designing systems with fault tolerance and predictable failure modes
- Security-conscious implementation without unnecessary complexity
- Preference for minimal, auditable, and controllable system behavior

## Engineering Experience (What I Actually Work On)
- Backend systems that interact closely with operating system behavior  
- Network-aware backend components and transport-oriented services  
- Linux server automation and service lifecycle management  
- Infrastructure deployment with a focus on reliability over novelty  
- Performance tuning guided by real-world constraints, not benchmarks alone  

---

## Engineering Philosophy
- Prefer **simple, understandable systems** over opaque abstractions  
- Stability and predictability are features, not afterthoughts  
- Systems should degrade gracefully, not fail catastrophically  
- If a system runs unattended, it must be observable and controllable
